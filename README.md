# NavPath

This project was my first real taste of React, and it helped me review some of my data structures and algorithms as well. Inspired by Clement Mihailescu, I took my first steps into the world of React and created NavPath, where people can see different pathfinding algorithms in action. You can check out the result at: https://vironaray.github.io/NavPath/


### Implemented Algorithms

* __Breadth-First-Search (BFS):__ an unweighted algorithm that utilizes a queue structure and guarantees an optimal solution
* __Depth-First-Search (DFS):__ an unweighted algorithm that utilizes a stack structure and does not guarantee an optimal solution
* __Dijkstra's Algorithm:__ a well-known, weighted algorithm that utilizes a priority queue and guarantees and optimal solution
* __A* :__ an algorithm that improves upon Dijkstra's algorithm by implementing heuristics
